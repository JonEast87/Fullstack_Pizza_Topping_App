# Frontend Startup

> After the setting up of the backend you will be able to run the front end using `npm install` and then after the download: `npm run start` which will start a local client on your `localhost:5000`.

---

> Before starting up you will need to update the `API_BASE_URL` in ./frontend/src/utils/api.js to represent your localhost which will be `localhost:5000` instead of the vercel url.

`const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || localhost:5000`
